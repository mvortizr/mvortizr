### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi! My name is MarÃ­a V. Ortiz. I'm ML enthusiast and an aspiring Data Scientist. :sparkles: :sparkles:

I am studying Computer Engineering. I love learning new things everyday, collaborate with others and try fun experiments with code. I would like to be an reseacher in the future and work in the intersection of neuroscience and AI. I've have mostly worked as a Web Developer before and I've created several React with Node web applications. I enjoy creating websites from scratch and contribute to Open Source projects. 

I am open for internships opportunities on Machine Learning, Data Science or Web Development.
