## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹ 

Hi! My name is MarÃ­a V. Ortiz. I'm ML enthusiast and FullStack Web Dev :sparkles:

I am studying Computer Engineering. I love learning new things everyday, collaborate with others and try fun experiments with code. I've have worked mostly as a Web Developer before and I've created several React with Node web applications as I enjoy creating websites from scratch and contribute to Open Source projects. 

I am open to internships/part-time opportunities on Machine Learning or Software Engineering.
